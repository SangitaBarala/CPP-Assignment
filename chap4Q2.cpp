/*Write a program that asks for the userâ€™s height, weight, and age, and then computes clothing sizes according to the formulas:

-> Hat size = weight in pounds divided by height in inches and all that multiplied by 2.9.
-> Jacket size (chest in inches) = height times weight divided by 288 and then adjusted by adding 1/8 of an inch for
each 10 years over age 30. (Note that the adjustment only takes place after a full 10 years. So, there is no adjustment for ages 30 through 39, but 1/8 of an inch is added for age 40.)
-> Waist in inches = weight divided by 5.7 and then adjusted by adding 1/10 of an inch for each 2 years over age 28. 
(Note that the adjustment only takes place after a full 2 years. So, there is no adjustment for age 29, but 1/10 of an inch is added for age 30.)
